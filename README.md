# high-low-game
A game for my students to practice high and low sounds/pitches on the browser


Using Next.js, Tailwind CSS, Phaser.js


## Why I decided to build this
My students love technology. There are so many different types of games and interactive activities that they are in sync with.
I also have to administer a standardized testâ€¦ as a music teacher.
This is where the idea for this project came from - creating a tool for my students to be able to practice identifying high and low sounds through the 
use of visual characters that they can control and play with, as simulated on the actual test that they will see at the end of the academic year.
